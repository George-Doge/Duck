# Duck Hunting Game

Welcome, this will be a simple duck-hunting game.

# v 0.1
Right now there is only one flying duck. The line represents a placeholder shotgun barrel until I find or draw some assets. Hunt Ducks and gain more ammo by clicking it if it spawns on the map.

I plan to add multiple ducks, which will appear randomly and more things.
Thanks for assets created by people in the [Credits](CREDITS.md)

## How to run
To run the game have the `assets` folder and executable (or `main.py`) together like in the main branch.
## TODO List
- [X] Some UI
- [X] Flying Animation
- [ ] Some menu
- [ ] Better collisions
- [ ] Probably more mechanics
- and many more!
