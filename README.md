# Duck Hunting Game

Welcome, this will be a simple duck hunting game. For now the minigame doesn't look appealing and most features don't work.

# v 0.1
Right now there is only one flying duck. The line represents a placeholder shotgun barrel until I find or draw some assets. Hunt Ducks and gain more ammo by clicking it if it spawns on the map.

I plan to add multiple ducks, which will apear randomly and more things.
Thanks for assets created by people in the [Credits](CREDITS.md)
