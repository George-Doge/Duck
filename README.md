# Duck Hunting Game

Welcome, this will be a simple duck hunting game. For now the minigame doesn't look appealing and most features don't work.

# v 0.1
- Right now there is only one flying duck. The (in my opinion weird) line represents a placeholder shotgun barrel until I find or draw some assets.
- You can shoot the duck for some points, but that is all. I plan to add multiple ducks, which will apear randomly and mor things.
- Thanks for assets created by people in the [Credits](CREDITS.md)
## TODO List
- [ ] Some UI
- [ ] Flying Animation
- and many more!
